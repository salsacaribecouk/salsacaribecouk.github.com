<div class="col" markdown="1">
  One to one dance classes will greatly accelerate your learning process & enhance your style. You may wish to improve your partner dancing technique (working on your leading & following skills), enrich your body movement, or increase your repertoire of dance rhythms, steps & moves. Or you may just want help in making that move up to the next level.
  
  Whatever your needs, your one to one session will be tailored to meet your specific requirements, so you'll be learning at your own pace - helping you to develop a real Cuban flavour to your dancing. And you'll be working with either Susan or Jim of Salsa Caribe Productions - two of the UK's most highly regarded teachers of authentic Cuban salsa.
