  SALSA CARIBE PRODUCTIONS are London's leading promoters of authentic Cuban salsa, presenting dance classes, workshops, club nights and performances, both in the UK and in Cuba. Our dance teachers, performers and DJ are amongst the most experienced and highly regarded in the UK.

  We specialise in teaching 'Casino' - the fresh, contemporary style of street salsa, that fuses traditional Cuban dance forms with elements of jazz, funk, hip hop, R&B, soca and Jamaican ragga & dancehall. We also teach and perform Cuban popular dances such as rumba, son, mambo and cha cha cha, as well as Afro-Cuban and carnival dances.

In addition to teaching and performing, we promote and host club nights & parties, including London's premier Cuban salsa night, and our resident DJ has one of the best reputations on the UK salsa scene.

We also organise and host Dance Cuba! - regular salsa holidays that have earned a reputation for being the best dance trips to Cuba available.

Formed by Susan - often cited as the UK's foremost teacher of Cuban salsa, and Doctor Jim - renowned for being the UK's leading Cuban salsa & timba DJ, Salsa Caribe's team includes Antonio from Brasil.
